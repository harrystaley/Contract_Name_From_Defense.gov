# Contract_Name_From_Defense.gov

## Project Overview

`Contract_Name_From_Defense.gov` is a Python-based tool designed to automate the process of scraping award descriptions from the Department of Defense (DoD) contract awards news site. The script efficiently extracts relevant data and outputs it into an organized Excel worksheet. This project is particularly useful for data scientists, researchers, and developers who require systematic data collection from web pages for analysis and reporting.

### Project Structure

The project includes the following files and folders:

- `scraper.py`: The main Python script that performs web scraping.
- `requirements.txt`: A file listing the necessary Python packages.
- `output/`: Directory where the Excel worksheets are saved after data extraction.
- `README.md`: Provides project information and instructions.

## Setup and Installation
